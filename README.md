# C_Data_Structures
Data Structures written in C

### The purpose of this repository
My goal in this is to begin learning the C programming language. To do this, I will be working through the algorithms in The Algorithm Design Manual written by Steven S. Skiena Second Edition


## Compiling and running C code
``` 
gcc <filename>.c // this compiles the code to the default filename a.out
./a.out // This will run the program
```
OR 
```
gcc <appname>.c -o <appname>.app // This compiles to a designated file.
./myApplication.app //This will run the program
```

### Sorting Algorithms branch
